# How Long Until?

A web app to show how long until various upcoming events. I get this question a lot from my kids.

Add birthdays, holidays, trips, and events to the list, and they automatically get updated in real time.

## Usage

Configure events by adding an `events.json` file - see `events.example.json` for possibilities.

Serve the files from the web server or install and use `http-server` using npm:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
